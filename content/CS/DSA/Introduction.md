- [ ]  Heap - Heapsort, Dijkstra, Median of a Stream
- [ ]  Binary Tree - Traversals(Pre-Order, Post-Order, In-Order, Level Order) - Lowest Common Ancestor, Left View of a Binary Tree, Maximum Path Sum 
- [ ]  HashMap - Whenever a quick lookup is needed
- [ ] Stack/Queue - Largest Rectangle in a Histogram
- [ ] Graphs - Graph Search(BFS, DFS, Dijkstra), Topological Sort, Loop in a Graph - Bus Routes
- [ ] Top-k Largest Elements(from array)
- [ ] Sliding Window(longest substring without repeating characters) 
- [ ] Backtracking(combination/target sum, word ladder, permutation, sudoku solver)
- [ ] Dynamic Programming(combination/target sum)
- [ ] DFS(implemented using stack(LIFO)) and BFS(implemented using queue(FIFO)) ex-Dijkstra's Algorithm, Topological sort
