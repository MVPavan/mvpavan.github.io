## Variables

- Explicit declared `var x:Int or var x:Int = 10 or var x = 10`
- Implicit declared  `x = 10`

Bothe implicit and explicit declared variables are statically typed - set in compile time, don't change at runtime.

## Struct

- Fixed memory: Compared to python class once declared you cannot add new variables at run time, once mojo struct is declared its memory is fixed and static
