Algorithms Binary Search: 
- Used to find a specific element in a sorted list efficiently. 
	- Inefficient: O(n) for linear search, incrementally guessing from start to end. 
	- Efficient: O(log2(n)) for binary search, repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the correct element is found. 
- Depth-First Search (DFS): 
	- Begins at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 
	- Utilizes a visited array to track already visited nodes. 
	- Continues backtracking until all nodes are visited. 
	- Real-life example: Solving a maze by systematically exploring paths until the exit is found. 
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): 
	- Looks at every node at one level before going down to the next level. 
	- Utilizes a visited array to track already visited nodes and a queue to keep track of neighbors. 
	- Begins at the root node and adds it to the visited array and all its connected nodes to the queue, then continues to explore nodes level by level. 
	- Real-life example: Chess algorithms predict the best move by exploring possible moves at each level of the game tree. 
	- Runtime: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. 
- Insertion Sort: 
	- Examineâ€™s each element in the list, comparing it with the previous elements and shifting them to the right until the correct position for insertion is found.
	- Simple sorting algorithm suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays. 
	- Runtime: 
		- Best case: O(n) when the list is already sorted. 
		- Worst case: O(n^2) when the list is sorted in reverse order. 
		- Efficient for small or nearly sorted lists, but inefficient for large unsorted lists. 
- Merge Sort: 
	- A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that breaks the problem into smaller subproblems and solves them recursively. 
	- Starts by splitting the array into halves recursively until each subarray consists of single elements. 
	- Merges pairs of subarrays by comparing elements and placing them in sorted order. 
	- Continues merging subarrays until the full array is sorted. 
	- Runtime: O(n log(n)) in both best and worst cases, making it efficient for large datasets. 
- Quick Sort: 
	- A complex sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach and is recursive. 
	- Selects a pivot element, ideally close to the median, and partitions the list into two sublists: one with elements greater than the pivot and the other with elements less than the pivot.
	- Continues the process recursively on each sublist until the entire list is sorted. 
	- Utilizes a pivot element that is moved to the end of the list, with pointers positioned at the leftmost and rightmost elements. 
	- Compares the elements pointed to by the left and right pointers, swapping them if necessary, until the pointers cross. 
	- Once the pivot is correctly positioned, the process repeats on the sublists. 
	- Runtime: 
		- Best case: O(n log(n)), when the pivot consistently divides the list into approximately equal halves. 
		- Worst case: O(n^2), when the pivot selection consistently results in unbalanced partitions. 
- Greedy Algorithm: 
	- A problem-solving approach that makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. 
	- May not always guarantee an optimal solution but is often simple and efficient. 
	- Real-life example: Finding the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm, where at each step, the algorithm selects the vertex with the smallest distance from the source.
