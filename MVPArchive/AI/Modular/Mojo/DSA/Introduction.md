LeetCode was HARD until I Learned these 15 Patterns:  
  
1. Prefix Sum  
2. Two Pointers  
3. Sliding Window  
4. Fast & Slow Pointers  
5. LinkedList In-place Reversal  
6. Monotonic Stack  
7. Top â€˜Kâ€™ Elements  
8. Overlapping Intervals  
9. Modified Binary Search  
10. Binary Tree Traversal  
11. Depth-First Search (DFS)  
12. Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
13. Matrix Traversal  
14. Backtracking  
15. Dynamic Programming Patterns  
  
I wrote a detailed article on these patterns and provide links to leetcode problems you can practice to learn them better.

1. Heap - Heapsort, Dijkstra, Median of a Stream
2. Binary Tree - Traversals(Pre-Order, Post-Order, In-Order, Level Order) - Lowest Common Ancestor, Left View of a Binary Tree, Maximum Path Sum 
3. HashMap - Whenever a quick lookup is needed
4. Stack/Queue - Largest Rectangle in a Histogram
5. Graphs - Graph Search(BFS, DFS, Dijkstra), Topological Sort, Loop in a Graph - Bus Routes

1. Top-k Largest Elements(from array)
2. Sliding Window(longest substring without repeating characters) 
3. Backtracking(combination/target sum, word ladder, permutation, sudoku solver)
4. Dynamic Programming(combination/target sum)
5. DFS(implemented using stack(LIFO)) and BFS(implemented using queue(FIFO)) ex-Dijkstra's Algorithm, Topological sort
